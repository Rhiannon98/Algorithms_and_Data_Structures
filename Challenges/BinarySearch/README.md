## Binary Search
  Searches for an element in an array snd gives back the index 
  location of the element in the array. 
​
## Challenge
  Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 
  parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without 
  utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your 
  language, return the index of the array’s element that is 
  equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
