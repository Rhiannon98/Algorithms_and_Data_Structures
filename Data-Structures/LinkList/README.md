## Linked List Implementation
  to find a node that is behind by a certain amount of spaces.  
  specifically where the current node is from the end of the list.  
  a node is a single unit in a chain of nodes that make up a linkd list.  
​
## Challenge
  in this challenge we were to create and implement linked lists (ll).  
  we were to add a new node, remove a node, add a node to the beginning of the ll,  
  add a node to the end of a ll, add a node before another, and add a node after another.
