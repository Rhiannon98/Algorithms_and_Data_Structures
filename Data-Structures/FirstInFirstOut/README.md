## First in First Out, Animal Shelter
  Has a list of given animals, each one has been in the shelter
  for a certain amount of time. If someone comes to the shelter 
  asking for an animal, return the cat or dog that has been waiting there
  the longest.
​
## Challenge
  Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
  Implement the following methods: 
	enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. 
	  animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
	dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. 
	  If pref, a string, is ‘cat’ return the longest-waiting cat. 
	  If pref is ‘dog’, return the longest-waiting dog. 
	  For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.
